# Project Overview  
The project is an **Interactive Media Platform** designed to enhance user engagement with audio content through a suite of interactive features. It aims to transform passive media consumption into an engaging experience by integrating functionalities such as:  

- **Media upload with automatic transcription**  
- **Context-aware interactions**  
- **Quizzes to reinforce learning**  
- **CMS integration**  
- **User feedback collection**  

This platform will simulate AI-generated responses and interactions while demonstrating potential integrations with content management systems, all within an accessible front-end UI. The objective is to provide a vivid showcase of interactive media capabilities within a practical development timeframe.

## Core Functionalities  

### Media Upload & Speech-to-Text Conversion  
- Upload audio files in various formats (e.g., MP3).  
- Automatic transcription of audio into text using a simulated speech-to-text engine.  
- Synchronized playback of audio with displayed transcribed text.  

### Interactive Content Pausing & Context-Aware Inquiry  
- Ability to pause audio playback at any point.  
- Selection of predefined questions related to specific content segments.  
- Display simulated AI-generated responses based on paused content.  

### Additional Engagement via Interactive Quizzes  
- Presentation of quizzes at predetermined points during audio playback.  
- Multiple-choice questions related to the content for user engagement.  
- Immediate feedback on quiz responses, including correct answers and explanations.  

### Demonstration of CMS Integration with Placeholder Data  
- Simulated interface for potential CMS integration.  
- Example data transfer and visualization to demonstrate integration capabilities.  
- Display of mock media titles and descriptions fetched from a fictional CMS.  

### User Feedback Module  
- Ability for users to provide feedback after using interactive features.  
- Feedback collection on user experience and satisfaction, recorded for demonstration.  

### Simulation & Placeholder Enhancements  
- Precrafted questions and answer pairs to simulate real AI interactions.  
- Use of sample data to illustrate CMS integration potential.  

### Front-End Demonstration  
- Cohesive UI showcasing all features in a single interface.  
- Visual indicators for user interactions, including quizzes and feedback.
