# Revised POC Specification for Interactive Media Platform  

## Feature: Media Upload & Speech-to-Text Conversion  
### **Functionality:**  
Users can upload audio files, which are automatically converted into transcribed text using a simulated speech-to-text engine.  

### **Use Case:**  
An educational content provider uploads a 3-minute podcast episode in MP3 format. The UI displays the transcribed text after a brief processing time, which the user can scroll through as they listen to the original audio playback simultaneously.  

---

## Feature: Interactive Content Pausing & Context-Aware Inquiry  
### **Functionality:**  
Users can pause the audio playback, ask predefined questions about the content, and receive simulated contextual responses generated by the system.  

### **Use Case:**  
While listening to the podcast, a listener pauses at **minute 1:45** and selects from a list of example questions like, _"What does [topic] mean?"_ The system displays a simulated AI-derived answer on the UI panel, explaining the current topic based on the transcribed content.  

---

## Feature: Additional Engagement via Interactive Quizzes  
### **Functionality:**  
During audio playback, a simple quiz related to the content appears, allowing users to respond and receive instant feedback.  

### **Use Case:**  
At **minute 2:00**, a prompt on the screen presents a multiple-choice question relating to the podcast content, such as _"What are the main points discussed so far?"_ The user selects an answer and receives immediate feedback highlighting the correct information and enhancing engagement.

## Feature: Demonstration of CMS Integration with Placeholder Data  
### **Functionality:**  
Provide a mock integration interface showing connection to a CMS, alongside example data transfer to demonstrate potential usage scenarios.  

### **Use Case:**  
A media company accesses a demo dashboard with a _"Connect to CMS"_ button. Clicking it displays a simulated data fetch from a CMS, showing example media titles and descriptions in the POC environment.  

---

## Feature: User Feedback Module  
### **Functionality:**  
After exploring AI interactions and quizzes, users can provide feedback about their experience, logged for demonstration purposes.  

### **Use Case:**  
After receiving a contextual answer and participating in a quiz, the user is prompted to rate their satisfaction with the interaction on a scale from **1 to 5**. The UI acknowledges this with a message _"Feedback recorded!"_ for clear user confirmation.  

---

## Simulation & Placeholder Enhancements  
- **AI Interactions:** Pre-crafted question and answer pairs closely mapped to the specific content sections will be used to simulate real interactions.  
- **CMS Data Display:** Use sample data pulled from a fictional CMS to illustrate real integration potential.  

---

## Front-End Demonstration  
Ensure every feature is accessible and clearly visible in a single, cohesive UI:  
- Upload, playback, and interactive controls.  
- Visual feedback for all user interactions, including quizzes and AI response viewing.  
- Integration simulation with feedback resulting in visible confirmation.  

The focus of this revised specification lies in vividly showcasing the transformation of passive media into engaging, interactive experiences while remaining practical for development within **one week**.
