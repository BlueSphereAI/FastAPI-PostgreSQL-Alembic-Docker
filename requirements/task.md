# AI-Driven Drug Repurposing Platform POC Specification

## Purpose
The purpose of this POC is to demonstrate key functionalities of our AI-driven drug repurposing platform within a single day of development. The primary goal is to showcase the value of optimizing failed drug compounds using AI to enhance binding affinities and suggest potential new applications.

## Key Features to Implement

### User Authentication & Dashboard Access
- Display a simple login page to mimic user authentication.
- After login, take users to a basic dashboard highlighting the feature flow.

### Compound Upload Interface
- Provide a straightforward form for users to enter basic compound information such as chemical structure or SMILES notation.
- Include a visual indicator (e.g., checkmark) to confirm successful upload.

### AI Simulation Preview
- Incorporate a placeholder animation (e.g., loading bar) to illustrate the AI analysis process.
- Provide a mock result summary upon completion, indicating a successful 'simulation.'

### Binding Affinity Visualization
- Display an easy-to-understand static chart demonstrating hypothetical improvements in binding affinity.
- Use a simple graph comparing 'Before' and 'After' AI analysis to indicate potential enhancements.

### Repurposed Compound Suggestions
- Present a list of potential repurposing paths using sample data with simple placeholders (e.g., "Compound X may be used for Y").
- Include brief descriptions of potential therapeutic areas for repurposing results.

### Download Summary Report
- Offer a 'Download Report' button that generates a static PDF summary of the simulated analysis.
- The report should include compound info, simulated binding improvement, and potential repurposing options.

## Implementation Notes
- Focus on clear and user-friendly interfaces to convey each function's purpose without backend processing.
- Use static data and visual placeholders where needed to simulate complex computations convincingly.
- Prioritize user experience and seamless transitions between steps to enhance demo impact.

This POC aims to provide a high-level demonstration of the platformâ€™s capabilities, promoting the core idea of using AI for drug repurposing insights. By focusing on key functionalities and using placeholders effectively, the demo will present the potential value to stakeholders convincingly.
