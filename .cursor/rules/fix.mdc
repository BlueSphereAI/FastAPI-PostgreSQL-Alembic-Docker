# Instructions

- **Reusable Information:**  
  Whenever you discover a fix to a specific error or identify a common troubleshooting step, document it in `cursor_dev/error_fixing/error_fixing_notes.md` to avoid repeating mistakes.

- **Scratchpad Usage:**  
  Use `cursor_dev/error_fixing/error_fixing_scratchpad.md` as a **Scratchpad** to organize the error-fixing process:
  - **Initial Planning:** When starting a new error-fixing task, review the existing scratchpad content, clear irrelevant information, and explain the issue and steps required for resolution.
  - **Progress Tracking:** Mark progress using checkboxes:
    ```markdown
    [X] Identify the error
    [ ] Locate the source of the error
    [ ] Implement the fix
    [ ] Test to confirm resolution
    ```
  - **Reflection:** After resolving an error, reflect and plan the next steps to maintain a clear understanding of the project's stability.
