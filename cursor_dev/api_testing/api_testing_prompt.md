# Important Guidelines

1. **Always Check the Scratchpad:**  
   Before starting a new testing task, review the scratchpad for incomplete tasks and prioritize them. Complete tasks sequentially and update the scratchpad accordingly.

2. **Task Implementation:**  
   - Implement tasks one by one.
   - Update the scratchpad upon completing a subtask or milestone.
   - Verify if any tasks are pending before considering a task as complete.
   -If a curl command is successful, add the curl command with a description to the file `cursor_dev/api_testing/curl.md`
   - If needed, add python dependencies to `backend/pyproject.toml`

3. **Avoid Missing Tasks:**  
   Ensure all tasks are accounted for and implementedâ€”never skip a task.

4. **API Location & Server Details:**

    - The Python code for the APIs is located at backend/app/api. Check all the APIs and perform testing.

    - If any issues are found, resolve them accordingly.

    - The backend server is hosted at http://localhost:8000. If the server is not found, inspect the backend directory to determine the correct server hosting details.

5. **Running the Server:**
  - Activate the Python virtual environment using the command 'source .venv/bin/activate' in the **backend** directory.
  - Run the backend server using the command `make runLocal`. The **Makefile** is located in the **backend** directory.
  - Observe the terminal for errors, warnings, or unexpected behavior.
  - Identify, analyze, and fix all errors found during runtime.
  



# Best Practices

- **Authentication:**  
  - Use environment variables for sensitive information:
    ```bash
    curl -H "Authorization: Bearer $API_TOKEN" https://example.com/api
    ```

- **Testing & Validation:**  
  - Compare responses with expected results and document discrepancies.
  - For complex testing scenarios, include example responses and analysis in the notes.

- **Documentation:**  
  - Document each tested endpoint, including request structure, parameters, headers, and example responses.
