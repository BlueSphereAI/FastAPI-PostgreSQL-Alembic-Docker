# Database Implementation Scratchpad

## Task Analysis
I need to implement and manage the database system for a fitness trainer booking application. The application allows users to find and schedule appointments with local personal trainers based on their fitness goals and availability.

## Database Models
Based on the requirements, I've identified the following models that need to be implemented:

1. User Model - Represents users with attributes like username, password_hash, email, etc.
2. Trainer Model - Extends User model for trainers with additional attributes.
3. Appointment Model - Represents appointments between trainers and clients.
4. Feedback Model - Stores feedback from clients about trainers.
5. Availability Model - Captures real-time availability of trainers.

## Current Status
I've examined the codebase and found that all the required models have already been created:
- User model in backend/app/database/user/model.py
- Trainer model in backend/app/database/trainer/model.py
- Appointment model in backend/app/database/appointment/model.py
- Feedback model in backend/app/database/feedback/model.py
- Availability model in backend/app/database/availability/model.py

## Next Steps
[X] Understand the database requirements and existing models
[X] Check the database configuration in docker-compose.local.yml
[X] Verify the database connection URL in .env.local
[X] Fix model issues (added ClassVar type annotations to enum classes)
[X] Generate database migrations using Alembic
[X] Apply migrations to create the database schema
[X] Verify that the database schema is correctly created
[ ] Test the database connection and models

## Database Configuration
- PostgreSQL database is running in a Docker container
- Database name: postgres
- Username: fastapi
- Password: fastapi
- Connection URL: postgresql+asyncpg://fastapi:fastapi@localhost:5432/postgres

## Issues Encountered and Fixes
1. **Issue**: Pydantic error for non-annotated attributes in enum classes
   **Fix**: Added ClassVar type annotations to the enum class attributes in UserType and AppointmentStatus classes

2. **Issue**: Missing PG_DATABASE_URL environment variable
   **Fix**: Set the environment variable before running Alembic commands

## Verification Results
- Successfully generated migration script: backend/alembic/versions/daa726f954d4_create_initial_tables.py
- Successfully applied migration with `alembic upgrade head`
- Verified that all tables were created in the database:
  - user
  - trainer
  - appointment
  - feedback
  - availability
  - alembic_version
