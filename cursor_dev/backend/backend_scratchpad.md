# Backend Implementation Plan

## Understanding the Requirements
Based on the requirements in `details.md`, `project_structure.md`, `prd.md`, and `task.md`, we need to implement a backend for a fitness trainer booking application with the following components:

1. User Management
2. Trainer Management
3. Appointment Scheduling
4. Feedback System
5. Availability Management

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Database Models
We need to create the following models:
- [X] User Model
- [X] Trainer Model
- [X] Appointment Model
- [X] Feedback Model
- [X] Availability Model

### 2. API Endpoints
We need to implement the following API endpoints:
- [X] Users Management Endpoints
  - [X] GET /api/users/{id}
  - [X] POST /api/users
  - [X] PUT /api/users/{id}
  - [X] DELETE /api/users/{id}
- [X] Trainer Management Endpoints
  - [X] GET /api/trainers/{user_id}
  - [X] PUT /api/trainers/{user_id}
- [X] Appointment Scheduling Endpoints
  - [X] GET /api/appointments
  - [X] POST /api/appointments
  - [X] PUT /api/appointments/{id}
  - [X] DELETE /api/appointments/{id}
- [X] Feedback System Endpoints
  - [X] GET /api/feedback/{trainer_id}
  - [X] POST /api/feedback
- [X] Availability Management Endpoints
  - [X] GET /api/availability/{trainer_id}
  - [X] PUT /api/availability/{trainer_id}

### 3. Implementation Steps
1. [X] Create database models
2. [X] Create schemas for request/response models
3. [X] Create API endpoints
4. [X] Register API routes in server.py

### 4. Current Progress
We have successfully implemented all the required components for the fitness trainer booking application backend:
1. Created all the database models and services
2. Created schemas for request/response models
3. Implemented all the API endpoints
4. Registered the API routes in server.py

The backend is now ready for use. To run the application, you would need to:
1. Apply database migrations using Alembic
2. Start the FastAPI server using Uvicorn
