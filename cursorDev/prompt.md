**Backend Development Implementation Guide**

## **Objective**
Develop and implement the backend tasks as specified in `requirements/details.md`, following the structured guidelines from `.cursor/rules/backend.mdc`.
---

## **Step-by-Step Instructions**

### **1. Understand the Development Requirements**
Before beginning the implementation, review the relevant files to gain a clear understanding of the scope, requirements, and technology choices:

- **Read `requirements/details.md`** – Understand the full scope of backend tasks and feature requirements.
- **Follow the implementation guidelines in `.cursor/rules/backend.mdc`** – Ensure best practices and structural consistency.


---

### **2. Backend Implementation**

#### **a. Organize the project structure**
Ensure the project structure follows the specifications outlined in `requirements/project-structure.md`.

#### **b. Implement Features & Components**
- Develop the backend based on the feature specifications in `requirements/details.md`.
- Ensure modular, scalable, and maintainable code.
- Ensure that all required libraries, frameworks, and configurations are correctly set up.

---

### **3 API Implementation Rule**  
- Referencing `requirements/details.md` and `requirements/project-structure.md`, implement each API group name in details.md with complete endpoint code, including actual database interaction logic, and configure router settings with the server **without user authentication**. 


---

### **4. Update Scratchpad & Notes Files**

#### **Scratchpad (`cursorDev/scratchpad.md`)**
- Log work-in-progress changes, ongoing debugging efforts, and temporary notes.
- Keep track of any bugs, blockers, or pending tasks.

#### **Notes File (`cursorDev/notes.md`)**
- Document key design choices, implementation decisions, challenges faced, and resolutions.
- Maintain a record of dependencies installed, performance optimizations, and areas for future improvement.
- Ensure that both files remain structured, up-to-date, and accessible for future reference.

---

### **5. Validate & Finalize the Backend Implementation**
- Cross-check the completed implementation against:
  - `requirements/project-structure.md` to ensure the correct project structure.
  - `requirements/details.md` to verify feature completion.
  - `.cursor/rules/backend.mdc` to ensure compliance with coding and development guidelines.
- Conduct final testing to verify that the implemented features function as expected.
- Resolve any inconsistencies, errors, or missing components before finalizing the backend codebase.
